📝 Assignment 2: Types of Software Testing
🧠 1. Define Functional and Non-Functional Testing. Give examples of each.

Functional Testing checks whether the software functions as expected. It verifies actions like logging in, submitting forms, or fetching data.

Example: Testing if a login button authenticates a user with valid credentials.

Non-Functional Testing checks the quality attributes of the software—like performance, usability, reliability, etc.

Example: Testing how long it takes for a dashboard to load under high traffic (performance test).
🔍 2. Differentiate between Unit Testing and Integration Testing.
Feature	Unit Testing	Integration Testing
Scope	Tests individual components or functions.	Tests combined modules working together.
Performed By	Typically developers.	Developers or testers.
Goal	Ensure a single unit works as intended.	Check data flow and interaction between units.
Example	Testing a function that calculates tax.	Testing login module + dashboard module.
🛠️ 3. Briefly explain System Testing and Acceptance Testing.

System Testing is done on the complete integrated system to verify if it meets the specified requirements. It is a type of end-to-end testing.

    Example: Testing an entire e-commerce app from login to checkout.

Acceptance Testing is the final testing phase before release. It checks if the software meets business requirements and is ready for delivery.

    Example: A client verifying the features they requested are working as expected.

⚙️ 4. List and explain any three types of Non-Functional Testing.

1. Performance Testing
Measures system speed, responsiveness, and stability under load.

2. Usability Testing
Evaluates how user-friendly and intuitive the software is.

3. Security Testing
Checks the software’s resistance to threats, hacking, and data breaches.
🧪 5. Why is it important to use different types of software testing?

Because each type focuses on different aspects of the system:

    Functional testing ensures features work correctly.

    Non-functional testing ensures the system performs well and is user-friendly.

    Unit and integration testing catch bugs early during development.

    System and acceptance testing ensure the product is ready for users.

Using all of them together increases quality, reliability, and user satisfaction.
