📝 Assignment 3: Static Testing Techniques 🔍
🎯 Learning Objectives

    Understand static testing concepts and techniques used to improve code quality without executing the program.

1. What is Static Testing? Why is it important in Software Development?

Answer:
Static testing is a type of software testing that involves examining the code, documentation, and design without actually executing the program. It's used to catch bugs early in the development cycle, which reduces the cost of fixing them later. It includes methods like code reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections.
🔑 Importance: It improves code quality, ensures compliance with standards, and helps maintain project health from the start.
2. Explain the difference between Walkthroughs, Technical Reviews, and Inspections.

Answer:
Technique	Description	Participants
Walkthrough	Informal meeting where the author explains the code or document to peers.	Author, team members
Technical Review	Structured meeting with technical experts to evaluate the quality of work.	Peers, technical experts
Inspection	Formal process to find defects, led by a moderator.	Moderator, reviewers, author

💡 Key Difference: Inspections are the most formal and rigorous, while walkthroughs are the most informal.
3. How do Static Analysis Tools help in Software Testing?

Answer:
Static analysis tools automatically analyze source code to detect potential issues such as syntax errors, security vulnerabilities, coding standard violations, and unused variables—without running the code. They help developers improve code quality and maintainability early in the software development lifecycle.
🛠️ These tools work like silent code reviewers running 24/7.
4. What are the benefits of using Static Analysis Tools?

Answer:
✅ Detect bugs early
✅ Enforce coding standards
✅ Improve code readability and maintainability
✅ Reduce time spent on debugging
✅ Enhance security by identifying vulnerabilities early
5. List and Describe 3 Popular Static Analysis Tools and Their Key Features
Tool	Description & Key Features
SonarQube	An open-source tool that detects bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Provides dashboards and integration with CI/CD.
ESLint	A JavaScript static analysis tool that helps find and fix problems in JS/TS codebases.
FindBugs / SpotBugs	Used for Java code. Detects issues like null pointer dereferences and dead code.
